from the chairman
west african relief agency ,
sir ,
with ultmost regard and hope for understanding , i wish to
solicit for your co - operation in this proposal .
first and foremost , name : mr antonio idris , the chairman of
west african relief agency , here in west africa . our
organization awarded a contract to a foreign company valued
at us $ 20 . 5 m . the contract was not finally executed , but in
my capacity as the chairman of the organization , i
purported that the contract had been executed and i equally
gave the name of the company as soft pedal international .
the contract payment from our organization had been
floating for the past six months . my foriegn partner and
confidant in this type of business died in a plane crash in
republic of benin , dated ; dec . 26 , 2003 .
and that is why i am contacting you to reprofile the fund
in your name and put claims to the money which the funds
are coming via private bank and this is a legitimate
transaction . you will be paid 10 % for your " management fees "
60 % for me and my colleagues , 20 % for the tsunami victims
and 10 % to cover the cost of the transfer . i am mainly
contacting you because my retirement from office will be
due soon and if i do not plan and put claims to the money ,
i will loose the money to the agency as the
new chairman might call back the money . on my side here as
the chairman , i will send all the authentic documents to the
fund to you for easy claim and transfer of the fund to your
account , while i come over for my share . if this interest
you , please do mail me .
