what is heartstat ?
it ’ s a monitor that slips on the patient ’ s arm and measures :
1 . blood pressure ( bp ) and heart rate on a continuous basis .
2 . how much blood the heart pumps i . e . blood flow .
hs ’ s continuous blood pressure monitor is already fda approved . the blood flow monitor uses similar non - invasive technology and will easily pass through fda clearance . remember , using this device is as simple as sticking a band aid on a patient ’ s arm
what is the future of heartstat ?
heartstat will revolutionist routine or , icu and er care . ultimately it will be in every place that patients are assessed including e . g . local doctors ’ offices and ambulances . it will provide complex , essential data in a simpler manner than routine bp cuffs tell us blood pressure readings now . and in the not too distant future it will allow optimizations of millions of patients on e . g . heart drugs , over the internet .
“ heartstat represents a true revolution in health care and will rapidly become the standard of care . ”
what is the need for heartstat :
one of the most difficult things in medicine is to decide who ’ s sick and who ’ s not . as of now there is no simple way to do this .
even super trained specialists , such as critical care doctors or anesthetists , find it difficult to recognize when a patient is going down the tube .
the traditional “ eyeballing ” the patient plus the classic four vital signs and blood oxygen levels don ’ t cut it . they tell too little too late .
prevention is always better than cure . this is what heartstat will do . it allows us to treat patients before they become catastrophically ill .
the key is blood flow ; blood flow within the patient ’ s body .
currently the methods to achieve this are costly , complicated to perform , with potentially lethal complications and can only be done by highly trained experts .
· it is estimated that only five percent of patients that need monitoring can have it because of costs and the inherent risks .
· what ’ s desperately needed is a simple non - invasive device that measures blood flow . this is the holy grail of modern medicine . and this is heartstat .
overview
heartstat technology , inc . ( “ heartstat “ ) developed and is bringing to market the first practical system for monitoring blood flow perfusion ( oxygen transport ) and important heart dynamics . it is noninvasive , continuous , and uses a simple comfortable disposable sensor . this addresses key issues of hospital critical care .
· blood pressure ( bp ) and pulse oximeter ( pox ) devices are the means of preventive monitoring and managing cardiovascular disease . however , these are commonly misleading and slow to reflect abnormality , often until it is too late .
· present cardiac output measurement is restricted to the most critical procedures on about only 5 % of patients because of risks and costs .
· blood flow and perfusion are early and more specific indications for managing vital patient risks ; yet this monitoring has not been practical .
