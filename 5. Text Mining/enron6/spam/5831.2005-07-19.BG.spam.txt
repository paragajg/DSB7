my late husband killed during the u . s . raid against
terrorism in
afghanistan , and during the period of our marriage we
could not produce
any child . my late husband was very wealthy and after
his death , i
inherited all his business and wealth . the doctors has
advised me that

decided to divide the
part of my wealth , to contribute to the development of
the church in
