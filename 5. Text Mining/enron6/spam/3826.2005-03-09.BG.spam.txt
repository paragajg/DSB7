why buy now
generex
biotechnology is a toronto - based , delaware corporation with a market - ready
solution to a central challenge in diabetes treatment – ending the pain and
hassle of insulin injections . ever since scientists early in the 20 th
century
learned that diabetes was caused by the body ’ s inability to produce a
normal
supply of insulin , patients have had to administer insulin by injection .
alternatives
that have been developed in recent years – pumps or needle - less “ pens ” –
are
still invasive and / or expensive . pharmaceutical companies have tried to
develop
a truly non - invasive insulin product that is pain - free , easy to use and
free from
serious side effects .
among
today ’ s competing technologies , only oral - lyn ™ ,
an
insulin spray to treatment diabetes , meets all those tests . after 10 years
of
development , oral - lyn ™ is ready for market and is
set
to produce enormous revenue growth for the company . generex
is little known outside a small community of investors focused on drug
delivery
and diabetes treatment . in the next few months , however , the expected
commercial
entry of oral - lyn ™ in south
america could raise generex ’ s
profile sharply , with a commensurate rise in their share price . small
companies
in drug and medical - device development are , of course , inherently high - risk
investments . but aggressive investors who take an early stake in these
firms
can profit several times over . generex has the
profile of being one such potential winner .
