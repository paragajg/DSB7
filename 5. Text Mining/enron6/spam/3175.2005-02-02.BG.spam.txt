Subject: interested in exchanging links
hello ,
i was looking around the internet for helpful resources and came across your website . i thought it would make sense to exchange links with your site . my website is a tremendous resource for information on arthritis , glucosamine and joint pain . this informative site doesn ' t sell anything but instead seeks to educate the public about arthritis and describe just how things like cox - 2 drugs can be fatal . there are literally hundreds of articles , clinical research , a discussion forum and simple explanations of scientific findings to explore . let me know when you have placed your link and i will put yours up in the category of your choice within 24 hours . to save you some time , i have created a sample link and included the html code below :
joint pain is something that nobody should have to live with . fortunately , information is power . explore the glucosamine and arthritis center for the latest information on glucosamine , arthritis and joint pain . read hundreds of articles , " plain english " clinical trial summaries , message board posts and more .
in health ,
