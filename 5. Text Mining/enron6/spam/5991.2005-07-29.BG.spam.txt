Subject: proposal
dear sir ,
first i must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction and
i
pray that my contacting you will be given genuine approval considering
the
fact that we don ' t know each other before . i wish to use this
opportunity to
introduce myself to you . i am mike kamokai , i am writing to inform you
of my
desire to invest , and to buy a house in your country .
i am the first son of chief joseph kamokai who was the former para
month
ruler of saradungu village of sierra - leone . my father was attacked by
the r
u f rebels on his way to lucia a northern part of sierra - leone and my
father
sustained injuries and he died three days .
before he died he revealed to me about the two boxes containing $ 50
million
u s dollars . which he deposited with a security company in ghana for
safe
keeping . my father did not disclose the content of the boxes to the
security
company . to avoid the officials from raising eye brows .
presently i and my mother are here in ghana to notify the security
company
of the claims , and we are staying in the refugee camp .
therefore i want you to lecture me on how best we can invest this money
in
your country , because my father told me that it is dangerous to invest
in
africa to avoid suspicions , and due to market instabilities coupled
with
economic and political situation facing africa for your assistance
myself
and my mother have agreed to offer you 20 % of the total amount of the
money .
we have all the vital documents covering the deposit and the ownership
which
i can send to you .
.
note , i have never disclosed this transaction to anybody apart from
you . so
please keep it very very confidential . call me on this number line
00233244774480 .
thanks .
best regards .
mike kamokai
