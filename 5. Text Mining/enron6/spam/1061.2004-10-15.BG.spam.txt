joke of the day
a blonde goes into work one morning crying her eyes out .
her boss , concerned about his employee ' s well being , asks sympathetically , " what ' s the matter ? "
the blonde replies , " early this morning i got a phone call saying that my mother had passed away . "
" i ' m terribly sorry to hear that . why don ' t you go home for the day . . . we aren ' t terribly busy . just take the day off to relax and rest . "
the blonde very calmly explains , " no , i ' d be better off here . i need to keep my mind off it and i have the best chance of doing that here . "
the boss agrees and allows the blonde to work as usual . " if you need anything , just let me know , " he says .
a few hours pass and the boss decides to check on the blonde . he looks out over his office and sees the blonde crying hysterically . he rushes out to her , and asks , " are you going to be okay ? is there anything i can do to help ? "
" no , " replies the blonde , " i just got a call from my sister , and she said that her mom died too ! "
