Subject: successful judgment recovery business
very substantial profit handling $ judgments .
dear jim ,
i can ' t thank you enough for introducting me to this business . you have
given me a fresh lease on life .
i was terminated from a job i held for 26 years . already earning twice as
much as i earned in my old job . making way over my old boss ' s pay .
i drive a 2005 jaguar s type and my old boss has an 8 year old ford van .
earning at the 6 digit level in a year and a half . having a ball in this
business .
its fun and yours truely a hero to the courts and to my clients . what an
exciting profession to be in .
doing exactly what your training tells me to do , working beautifully . i go
to the court and locate all of the clients i can handle . i use your advanced
reporting services to locate all assets and jobs . using your forms i send
them out to the appropriate agencies .
then the $ $ arrive to yours truely . its like magic . i love it . able to
take a holiday when ever i have a whim to do so . hawaii and a 1050 footer
to the panama canal etc . so far this year .
please show this reference to others . this industry so big it requires
lots of us helping the courts and the people who have been damaged .
sincerely
