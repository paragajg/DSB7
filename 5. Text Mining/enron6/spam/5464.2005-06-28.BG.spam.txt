malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2 oo 5 - - vinobie , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a hoiding company seeking to identify | ong - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemica | industries .
although sma | | wireiessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possibie problems before they become serious , they
can
also deiiver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a weil fi | | ing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy appiications , rfid can aiso provide
the
safe transit of materiais by oniy the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific | ocations . ensuring personne | safety is
essentia | , should there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags would
enabie the customer to track and evaluate its empioyee ' s safety and / or
danger . this appiication technoiogy requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuabie
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s suppiy chain by tracking oi | , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail | evel .
vinobie ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these appiications are
more
than just a valuable too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinobie in
a rapidiy expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capita | and gioba | spending that the company wi | | require
for
growth . the company ' s goa | is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smaliest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potentia | for this company is
exceptiona | . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .
