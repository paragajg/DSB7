royal pet meal products are all premium meal selections , natural , organic , and wholesome , all designed to improve the
quality of life for pet and pet owners . since a large percentage of this booming pet market is serviced by small business vendors ,
royal pet meals management feels that ! this highly fragmented marketplace lends itself to both niche marketing and consolidation
of vendors . royal pet meals , inc . intends to capture various niche markets and acquire / merge with selected profitable vendors ,

analyst conclusion
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
the recent sec ruling to leave the over the counter bulletin board in its current form is a very bullish sign for this market - possibly
a turning point . we think that this is an encouraging signal from regulators that the otcbb can expect a more positive financial
climate going forward . we assessed rypm and found it met our 4 basic investment criteria :
1 . clearly rypm has enormous growth potential .
2 . the company financials are strong .
3 . rypm is in a leading i ! ndustry .
4 . rypm is offered at an ideal buy point .
pets are big business and everyone is getting interested . in the space of the past four weeks , the today show has run two segments ,
the cbs early show each ran a segment , abc world news tonight ran a piece , us news and world report ran a piece about
global pet expo and the wall street journal ran an article on the industry . this is in addition to the numerous articles run in
everything from the la times and washington post to the east nowhere gazette sun journal .
the word is out and we all should be ready to take advantage of it .
