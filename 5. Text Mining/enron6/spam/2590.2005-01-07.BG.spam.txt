Subject: helping rescues raise funds
hello , my name is steven gray and i want to
share with you a program that helps animal rescues , shelters , schools , churches , and other non
profits raise much needed funds . the best part is that there is no out of pocket expense ! it ' s as
simple as collectingcell phones that are no longer in use . the charity werks program is simple to implement ; we will
do all we can to make it easy and profitable . charity pays the charity for each cell phone that
itcollects ( depending on model and condition of the phone ) , and the personor organization
that donates the cell phone / phones can receives a tax deduction . depending upon which study
you look at , there is an estimated 250 million cell phonesin people ' s homes in the united
states alone and over 55 million cellphones discarded every year and growing . the
number of discarded cellphones is predicted to swell to 500 million phones by the end of
2005 . people seem to feel that their old cell phones have value and they arereluctant to
discard them into the trash . with a charitable motive , people are willing to take that
old cell phones and donate them for acause they believe in whereas they would be reluctant to
take the timeto find and deliver the cell phone for a small cash payment . i would love to talk to you more about this program to see if i can help you
raise the funds your organization needs . please feel free to e - mail me at contact @ charitywerks . com or go to our website at http : / / www . charitywerks . com . if you
