dear
re : your assistance is highly needed
i am very sure that this mail will bring lots of surprises and curiosity to you since there was no previous correspondence before now between us .
i am a widow of one of the top rulers in chechnya , my husband died along side with the chenchan president who was killed in a bomb attack early this year in a parade ground .
my husband told me before his death that he has a deposit of $ 23 m which he deposited overseas and handed to me all the documents which my lawyer has confirmed with the bank .
right now i am looking for an investor who will help me to invest the total sum in the west and after which i will relocate to your country .
the security situation in chechnya does not warrant me to do much from here ; therefore i have designated my family lawyers who will co ordinate every aspect of the fund transfer and the investment with your assistance .
i am ready to concede up to 25 % of the funds to you as your share if you will help me to pull the funds and invest it in your country which has a stable economy .
upon receipt of your acceptance letter to my private mail box quoted above , i will introduce you to my family lawyer for details on how the transfer can be done in the shortest possible time .
awaiting your urgent response via any of the email addresses stated above .
regards
mrs . victoria igor
