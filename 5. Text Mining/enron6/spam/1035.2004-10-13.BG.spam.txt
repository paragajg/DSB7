you must have been a very little fellow when you were taken so far away from your home and parents tell me and tell me true was the city in which your father and mother lived sacked and pillaged or did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or cattle ship you off here and sell you for whatever your master gave them stranger replied as regards your question sit still make yourself comfortable drink your wine and listen to me .
the nights are now at their longest there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking together you ought not to go to bed till bed time too much sleep is as bad as too little if any one of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so he can then take my master s pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning .
we two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut and telling one another stories about our misfortunes for when a man has suffered much and been buffeted about in the world he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows that have long gone by as regards your question then my tale is as follows you may have heard of an island called that lies over above where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction it is not very thickly peopled but the soil is good with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep and it abounds with wine and wheat dearth never comes there nor are the people plagued by any sickness .
