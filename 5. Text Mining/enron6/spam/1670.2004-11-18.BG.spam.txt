dear sir ,
i am sebastine vanhans , bank manager ; long term fixed deposit department , of tradevco bank of liberia . i have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you .
on june , 1999 , an american oil consultant / contractor with the liberian mining corporation , mr . ron williams made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 ( fourteen million , two hundred thousand united states dollars ) in my branch .
upon maturity , we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the liberian mining corporation that mr . ron williams died from an automobi
le accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless .
i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . ron williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 14 , 200 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come forward to claim it .
i and two other top managers in the accounts and auditing department had to use our position to move this funds to our off - shore finance company in europe , and we had all documents prepared as if one of mr ron cousin had finally come forward for the claims and has instructed that the funds be transfered to europe as he would not be able to travel down to liberia for the claim due to his health problem , and we had to use this means to transfer this funds , and now the funds has sucessfully arrived the finance company in europe , so we really need your urgent assistance in moving this funds as soon as possible into your nominated bank
according to liberian financial law of unclaimed deposit , at the expiration of 5 { five ) years , the funds will be transferred to treasury account with the federal reserve bank as free funds for the government . consequently , the need to contact you in order to stand in as the next of kin to mr . ron williams so that the fruits of this old man ' s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is legal , simple and clear .
i will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin / beneficiary to his estate .
we shall employ the service of an accredited attorney for drafting and notarization of the ? will ? and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favour for the transfer . a bank account in any part of the world , which you will provide , will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin .
the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60 % for me and 40 % for you .
there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately reply back to us via email address above .
upon your response , we shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction .
please observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .
