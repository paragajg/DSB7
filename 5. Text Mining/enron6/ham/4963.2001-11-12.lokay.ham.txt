upon receipt of a notice to exercise rofr , you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required , in the example provided i ' m told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10 / 31 / 02 , notice was due 10 / 31 / 01 . therefore 10 days after 10 / 31 / 01 the capacity must be posted for bidding . in the interim , since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the rofr process . if this isn ' t clear , please call mk
