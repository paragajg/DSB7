mei - ling ,
i put the index table on etstest . twprodol , etsmo . twprodol , and mojo . twprodol
and i have added a job to refresh the new table in production . in
development ( etshousdl 1 . gpgrms ) i have dropped the view rms _ basis _ nymex _ view
and created a new view rms _ basis _ nymex _ partial _ view . i have also loaded the
data to etstest . twprodol . after you have tested and when you request the
migration , please request the deletion of the view rms _ basis _ nymex _ view on
etsmoe . gpgrms and etshouspo 9 . gpgrms and the creation of the new view in these
two environments . also request the modification of the ashwin job : dba mojo
misc : twprodol . rms _ basis _ load to pull from the new view .
please send the request directly to my mail box , i will complete and send to
the ets dba mailbox as completed .

meiling ,
do you want the same logic you have in the attached query for the " nymex "
also or like the current nymex selection do you want everything and you
filter the most current ?
also for the future , creation of new tables require a database change form .
thanks ,
margaret

subject : download basis differential for tw ( rms _ basis table )
margaret ,
the basis differential for tw is available in rms database now , i like to
request a nightly download
from rms database to twprodol database in etstest / etsmo / mojo .
you set up nymex price dowload to rms _ basis for me ealier .
since there are more than one type of index coming in this time , i think we
also need rms _ index in
sybase side .
attached is the sample sql from ray volpone .
thanks ,
