team , please make arrangements with darryl and gallup to dry pig the lateral . after dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff . ' s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the dra . you might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the april / may time frame .
vera / tim , we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month .
ben , can you provide estimated volumes to jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the dra .
as we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf . call to better coordinate activities as necessary .
questions or concerns ? ? ? ?

ben , need to know how the san juan lateral eff . is holding up so that we can better estimate when o & m budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities . i know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist .
jerry , please correct me if i am wrong , but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity ytd .
