Subject: capacity options on tw
attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on
transwestern . the attachments include a filing letter , proposed tariff
language and a proposed form agreement .
obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out . i am
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue
about the larger issues first . a few that come to mind are whether we want
to commit to selling options online , how best to explain or justify the
option fee , and what specifically in the industry has changed such that ferc
should depart from existing policy and allow tw to essentially reserve future
capacity for shippers . please let me know your thoughts on these and any
other issues .
i would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording , other conforming
changes to the tariff , and other comments concerning form until after we have
resolved the substantive issues . thanks .
