Subject: nymex info on desktop pc ' s
one of the deliverables of revenue management is the marketing dashboard
which , among a veritable cornucopia of features , will include live nymex and
enron online data pricing feeds . the rollout of the dashboard for nng and tw
is in the next 2 weeks . however , the nymex data feed won ' t happen till
august due to technology limitations .
in the meantime , via our desktops , we all have access to enron online which
provides live market data that is as good or better than nymex . this should
suffice in the interim till the dashboard is fully functional . let me know
if you have questions .
thanks
