Subject: eog pronghorn location
michelle , i thought i would pass this along to make you aware that now eog
isn ' t going to supply the efm at their new location . given that they have
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts , i don ' t think we
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the
$ 10 , 000 . maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the
estimate back to the $ 30 , 000 we originally requested .
thanks , bob

on the efm / scada , i talked to dirk ellison with eog . he contacted jerry
ball and their reply was for us to go ahead and get our own equipment .
laura ' s work order doesn ' t have anything about efm , only the costs to inspect
the construction and their connection to our tap valve . laura will check on
the responsibility of the efm equipment tomorrow .
thanks
