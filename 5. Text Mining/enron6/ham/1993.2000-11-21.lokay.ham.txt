holiday safety reminder
the holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office
parties . we would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the
city of houston fire department and the houston police department .
? please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators .
this defeats security .
? use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space . do
not place cut trees or greenery within the building . cut trees become major
fire hazards when they dry out .
? office parties or the holiday mood may distract you . be alert for thieves
who try to take advantage of the holiday season . sometimes just having fewer
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves . if you see
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area , immediately call
the enron security console at 713 - 853 - 5360 .
? keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer
or closet .
? if you go shopping , invite a friend to go along . try not to overload
yourself with packages . when you return , lock your gifts away in a safe
place .
? always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area . if things don  ,
t look right , follow your instincts and avoid going into the area .
? when waiting for a ride home after hours , remain inside the building near a
card - reader door until you see your ride arrive .
? if office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages
or public invitees , call security at 713 - 853 - 5360 . security will advise you
as to company guidelines .
