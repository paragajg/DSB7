attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for january 2002 capacity release transactions . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
fyi - based on the flash invoices i generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts , please note the following :
ena k # 24924 res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50 / 50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to burlington
conoco k # 20748 res - delete the thoreau to e . thoreau line item
conoco k # 20835 comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
texaco k # 25923 / 25924 comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4 . 5 % between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes , there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding . need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes ; and if delivery makeup scheduled , then invoice should be adjusted accordingly .
please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2 / 26 / 02 . i will review again on the lst .
schedulers - please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [ some contracts are based on calculations , especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage ] .

thanks ,
