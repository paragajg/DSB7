Subject: fw : ferc requirements for california market reporting
please note charge code discussion under item lh . we need to discuss soon . this will be something we need to maintain . it will be a place where the " total rate " for a contract is stored . because of the shifting between reservation and commodity on these contract rates , the report wouldn ' t be able to get the accurate rate . a charge code is being set - up for there to be a single slot to put the total rate . after checking invoices yesterday , i ' m not sure this is such a bad idea in general anyway . we may want to be able to run a copy of this report by contract # to see the total rate for invoice / firm book verification purposes .

now that the latest round of tw ' s negotiated rate hearing is behind us , we can re - focus our attention on the monthly reporting requirements imposed by the ferc on july 25 , 2001 . please review the attached document that addresses all the issues that were raised in prior meetings and provide your comments by cob september 7 , 2001 .
i will then work with don powell to gather / compile the data required for the september 30 th filing and distribute to the primary reviewers by mid - month . once the reviewers have had an opportunity to analyze the data , we can distribute for review and discussion . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
thanks ,
