Subject: re : oneok contract
the attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with drew about the
marketing fee . the fts - 1 agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement
( i . e . , minus the marketing fee language ) and the parties will execute the
attached instead . questions or comments - - let me know .

subject : oneok contract
attached is the proposed contract with oneok . since it is a maximum rate
deal , there is no discount letter . however , i am circulating this for
approval because it contains a special provision ( found in the " other "
section ) regarding marketing of capacity for release , as allowed by section
30 . 8 of the general terms and conditions of transwestern ' s tariff .
christine , you and michele will need to fill in the address and account
information . my sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual
here , i felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval
as soon as possible .
please e - mail your approval to christine and me by noon tomorrow if
possible . thank you .
