subject : re : eog pronghorn location
if we bare any expense , eog is suppose to reimburse us , but getting money out
of them is like pulling teeth .
i suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to
proceed when necessary . marketing is not in a position right now to pay the
cost of the efm . given that these volumes will flow under a " pooling
agreement " , there isn ' t any incremental revenue generated for tw .
we will get with eog to request payment for the efm before we proceed . any
idea how much the efm will cost ?
