Subject: transwestern capacity release report - 9 / 2001
attached is the transwestern capacity release report that provides information for september 2001 invoicing . the spreads to the california border narrowed during the month of september . therefore , two of the three index - based packages released by pg & e ( core ) are below tw ' s max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ( $ 0 . 4455 / dth ) , which does exceed the max tariff rate .
tw schedulers - i have left a copy of the flash invoices ( processed as of late friday ) for all capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts in amy ' s chair for your final disposition . i have flagged all which may require some additional review / correction on your part . i will be on a flight out monday lunchtime for customer training and will not be back in the office until thursday . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me by pager ( 800 - 718 - 0830 ) .
thanks ,
elizabeth
