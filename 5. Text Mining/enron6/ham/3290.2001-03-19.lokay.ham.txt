dynegy : enron a ' model competitor '
it doesn ' t happen very often , so we ' re noting an apparently spontaneous comment from dynegy counsel ed ross at a ferc roundtable last week that one of his chief competitors , enron , " has done an excellent job of being competitive . " he suggested others could look to enron as a " model competitor . they ' ve done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don ' t see any problem with it . i think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business . "
ross had prefaced the remark , midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses , with the comment that " this is not an industry - wide problem . i believe there are good and bad players in the market today . "
earlier , enron ' s leslie lawner had invited " all of you to spend the day on enron ' s trading floor , because i assure you , you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere . there is no way these folks , who fight like cats and dogs among themselves , would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line . " lawner had to quickly back off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor .
