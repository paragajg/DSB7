thank you , ets !
friday ' s united way appreciation lunch was great fun . team ets , lisa sawyer , rod hayslett , colleen raker , brad holmes , john millar , john keller , marcello minotti , and pam daily , made us proud .
on top of being named enron ' s champion lego builder , ets was also awarded most ambitious . the picture in the link below captures our awesome team and our winning structure .
now let ' s show the rest of the organization that ets employees are as generous as we are innovative , bold and talented .
at friday ' s lunch , i challenged the other business units to raise more money for united way and to have a greater participation rate than ets . we can ' t let this happen because i don ' t want to bake cookies for mark frevert !
to date , ets has raised more than $ 214 , 000 , which is about 62 % of our total goal of $ 346 , 000 . that ' s the good news .
the bad news is our participation rate is less than 50 % . i know we can achieve 100 % participation .
if you ' ve given to the united way , thank you . your contribution makes a difference right here in our community .
if you haven ' t made your contribution , you still have time . please log on to today to make your contribution . you ' ll need your gis number to make your contribution .
if you don ' t have your gis number or need assistance with keying in your contribution , please call gina taylor ( x 37681 ) or sarah haden ( x 53383 ) .
please remember that contributions made last year don ' t automatically roll over to this year . you ' ll need to enter your 2002 contribution on - line .
your contribution to the united way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the houston community .
don ' t miss the opportunity to help houston build its future .
