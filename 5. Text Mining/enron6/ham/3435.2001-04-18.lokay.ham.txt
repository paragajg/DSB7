natural gas prices will be sustained above $ 5 . 00
this spring and summer will present a major challenge to natural gas markets - - refilling storage inventories while meeting underlying growth from power
demand . achieving these goals will require some demand to be held off of the
market , which will in turn require gas prices to remain above those of
distillate fuel oil .
* cera expects april to have the strongest injections since 1998 .
* gas prices will remain close to those of distillate through the end of
may .
* prices will be volatile , as the market is still in a precarious
situation .
* * end * *
