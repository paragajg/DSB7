and lower energy demand in the west have driven daily power prices below $ 100
per megawatt hour ( mwh ) . the summer brought the region ' s strongest sustained
power and gas markets in recent history . for fall and winter , cera expects
western spot power and gas prices to be higher and more volatile than in past
years , with october on - peak power prices at $ 114  ) $ 143 per mwh and winter
prices around $ 74  ) $ 92 per mwh , depending on location . august ' s el paso
pipeline explosion intensified the summer ' s supply bottlenecks . although
service on the southern system was quickly restored , the supply disruption
affected storage inventories , with a heavy summer draw in california
weakening already dwindling inventories . for two weeks , pipeline capacity
limits on el paso ' s pipe into california pushed topock differentials to
nearly $ 2 . 00 per mmbtu , and the access constraint intensified downward
pressure on rocky mountain !
and san juan prices . the topock differential fell back last week after
averaging over $ 1 . 00 per mmbtu for most of september . the rush to inject
storage inventories ahead of heating season should limit further declines in
that differential .
