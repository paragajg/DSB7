Subject: message from stan horton - egs management change
we have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations , bankruptcy related issues , managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues . while i have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges , we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful .
in light of the above , i have asked danny mccarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for enron global services ( egs ) . danny ' s responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities , the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses .
until the question of our right to repurchase northern natural gas is resolved , it is better to minimize organizational changes . consequently , i do not plan to replace danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of enron transportation services ( ets ) at this time . steve harris , bob hayes , rob kilmer , shelley corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me .
i truly appreciate danny ' s willingness to take on this responsibility . his involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues , while allowing jim hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day - to - day operations .
as always , thank you for your continued dedication and support .
