a hydrostatic test of line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced ,
el paso said thursday ,
and once that is done the test must be performed again . it estimated the
project will extend through
sunday , reducing bondad mainline capacity by 180 mmcf / d ( normal capacity is
675 mmcf / d ) and
affecting seven receipt points . with line 3201 out of service , the 180 mmcf / d
loss can not be made
up at points downstream of bondad mainline , el paso said . thus the same ( not
additional )
180 mmcf / d reduction must be applied at gallup ( nm ) station .
pg & e gas transmission - northwest said its internet - based nomination system
became operational
again thursday morning after a wednesday evening power failure caused the

details of its line no . 2000 project . the project requires ferc approval to
abandon certain mainline
compressor facilities and replace them with a 30 - inch crude oil pipeline upon

buying part of the
all american pipeline from plains all american pipeline l . p . and would invest
