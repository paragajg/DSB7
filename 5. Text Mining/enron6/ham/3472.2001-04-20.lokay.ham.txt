Subject: transwestern pipeline
i don ' t think we ' ll be interested in this expansion .
question , what happens if you have more interest in the transport , then
the 150 m / day , how do you allocate this transport ?
also , we have the tw contract . i am hving trouble structuring the gas
deal the way we want . i ' ll continue to get this finished , and then we
plan on signing the contract .
