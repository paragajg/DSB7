Subject: tw electronic contracting filing
on february 27 th , the ferc approved tw ' s electronic contracting filing to become effective march 4 , 2002 . we made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in market services . shippers can still contract via fax and in writing ; however , they will now ( i believe after this coming weekend ) by able to do requests and contracting electronically . this include capacity release . there were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements , but i believe most of these were already occurring ; we just updated the tariff language .
one change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within 15 days instead of 30 days .
if you have any questions , please call myself ( x 54600 ) or teb ( x 36868 ) .
