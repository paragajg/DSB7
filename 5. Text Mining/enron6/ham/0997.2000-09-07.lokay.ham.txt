Subject: temporary labor sourcing project
enron ' s preferred provider contract for administrative and office temporary
labor with pro staff expires at the end of the year .
we are currently reviewing enron ' s options in the area of sourcing
administrative and office temporary labor to provide the best service to
enron ' s user community and capture the greatest value for enron . as part of
the process , a request for proposal ( rfp ) will be provided to selected
vendors in september with a target date for selection in early november .
the potential outcomes of the rfp process may range from selection of a
preferred provider through use of an integrator to provide centralized
reporting , centralized billing , and overall reduced internal administrative
burden and costs .
team members representing a cross section of the users of this service will
provide requirements , evaluate vendor responses and communicate with their
functional and business unit constitituents throughout this process .
we request your feedback on specific needs or vendors you think should be
considered in this process to one of the team members below or diane eckels ,
