along the same lines , we could possibly do an efbh deal with brt for a portion of their 80 , 000 / d sj - eot deal ( dp ' s to wtx ) . again , i ' m sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate , but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications . over the last year , brt hasn ' t scheduled less than 70 , 000 / d on average under that agreement .

what if we could contract with agave under the efbh rate schedule for gas from red bluff & bitter lakes ( located north of wt - 1 & south of p - 1 ) to deliveries off the south end of the wtx lateral ? then we could sell westward capacity through wt - 1 under rate schedule fts - 3 . agave nominates a total of 50 , 000 / d to 60 , 000 / d from these supply sources into the central pool , but this gas does not need to flow through wt - 1 . maybe agave ' s existing 40 , 000 / d east could be done under efbh ( if agave didn ' t want to commit to incremental firm ) , but they would have the obligation to flow - i ' m sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment . anyway , it could be cheaper than some of the options we discussed yesterday or it could be something we would want to do in addition to modifications to wt - 1 ( for red rock & pnm deals ) .
kevin , let ' s get together monday so i can fill you in on the status of wt - 1 capacity .
