on july lst , project apollo and beyond launched its final sap implementation .
enron now has an integrated , common financial , human resources , procurement ,
and project management system throughout the majority of enron ' s businesses .
by far enron  , s largest sap implementation , this  & go live  8 added approximately
8500 new users  ) raising the total user population from apollo and beyond
implementation efforts to over 13 , 000 enron employees and contractors .
a highlight of this implementation was the rollout of ehronline , an
intranet - based system that enables individuals to manage their personal
information and time management activities plus view their pay information
and benefit elections . this new system gives the power and capability for
managing your information to the person who knows the most about it  ) you !
the apollo and beyond solution will yield savings of over $ 30 million per
year plus provide increased speed and accuracy of information . once
post - implementation efforts have been successfully completed , the focus will
turn to system support , enhancements , and additional projects to help
leverage enron ' s sap system for increased growth and profitability .
