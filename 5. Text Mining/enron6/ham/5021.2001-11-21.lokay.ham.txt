Subject: br / tw window rock meeting scheduled for dec 3 rd
michelle ,
we are looking forward to the planned meeting between br and tw to further discuss the window rock interconnect . the following is
an informal agenda listing of topics :
1 . br would provide an overview of our november 6 th discussions with epng regarding the window rock interconnect .
2 . as discussed , it would be beneficial if tw would be able to discuss the operating parameters along tw ' s pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed red rock expansion . in particular , br would be interested in expected pressures / volumes at window rock , station 4 , 5 and
thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with ommcf / d , 50 mmcf / d , 100 mmcf / d , and 150 mmcf / d delivered at window rock into tw .
the window rock deliveries into tw would physically service markets to the west while allowing tw to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to br .
3 . discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow window rock deliveries .
4 . review potential alternative delivery points into tw for backhaul service .
5 . discuss potential meeting between tw / epng / br
please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics . we look
forward to meeting with you monday , dec 3 rd in our office at 3 pm . thanks ,
