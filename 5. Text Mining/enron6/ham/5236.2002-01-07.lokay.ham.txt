michelle :
ok we are all set up . we are going to do a snow shoe trip on tuesday at 10 : 30 a . m . for 2 hours . supposedly easy trail , just enough to work up a sweat . then we are going to drive ( 45 minute scenic drive ) to hot springs , co . probably have time for a lunch . our messages are set up for 3 : 00 p . m . and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure . sounds divine doesn ' t it ?
since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops . he says we can rent towels and robes but if i remember i ' ll bring them for us as backups if they don ' t have any available .
so looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops . oh yeah , do you have a warm pair of boots . we can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots . if you don ' t think you have a pair let me know and i can bring an extra pair along . hopefully they won ' t be too big for your tiny feet . but boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks !
let me know ,
