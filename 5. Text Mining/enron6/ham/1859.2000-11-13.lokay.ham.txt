mike ,
boy , the more things change , the more they stay the same . . . .
you are correct that eog does not give us the ok to " go ahead " .
eog has agreed to wire funds to tw today to cover the cost of installing the
efm , quality monitoring equipment , and whatever additional cost we incurred .
in typical eog fashion however , they want everything done yesterday , after
their actions delayed the activity by over a week . to the extent we have the
equipment available , and can install it , they would like to flow the gas as
soon as possible . is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing
all the equipment we need , or is the gas too bad to risk it ? they have gone
ahead and told our market services people they are delivering the gas for
tomorrow ' s gas day , and i suspect that is a little aggressive . do you have
an idea when the gas will be available ?
thanks for your help , bob
