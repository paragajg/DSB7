lindy - could you verify if poi # 57096 is still valid for any reason ?
ramona - it appears that some of these points are available for displacement . in the new system , linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid . i will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template ( ie , if a delivery point allows displacement , then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template . nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles . ) .
thanks ,
elizabeth

subject : tw contract template clean - up
in cleaning up some template information , the following points were found to be on no templates .
1 . do they belong on a template ?
2 . is the template listed the correct one ?
unless i hear differently , i will go ahead and update the templates accordingly .
