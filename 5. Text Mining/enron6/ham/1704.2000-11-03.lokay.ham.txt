Subject: a couple of transportation notes on el paso and nova
el paso declared an unauthorized overpull penalty situation thursday that
will remain in effect until further notice . the pipeline said it will limit
scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system
integrity .
likely in response to the a / bc border constraint that began thursday due to
maintenance on the transcanada - british columbia line , nova changed its
imbalance tolerance range to + 2 % / - 18 % wednesday . reflecting the resultant
shift in supply accessibility , neighboring westcoast has a + 20 % / 0 % tolerance
in effect .
