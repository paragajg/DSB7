patterns worldwide for the last three or four years , have finally
dissipated . however , their impact on the weather will likely continue for
some time to come , according to nasa scientists , based on the latest
satellite data gathered this month over the pacific . while pacific water
temperatures have gradually warmed over the past three to four months to
near normal in the tropics , the after effects of la nina are seen in
persistent below - normal temperatures in the bering sea and gulf of alaska .
