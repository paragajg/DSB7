Subject: tw outage
operations is digging out 2000 feet of pipe to begin the hydro test today or
thursday . if the test results are good , they ' ll recoat the pipe and put it
back in service . we could be at 80 % volume on friday afternoon , but this is
tentative .
also , the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas
that need inspections west of station 5 . while east of thoreau is down ,
these 4 areas will also be inspected .
do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further
information . we will make a posting hopefully this afternoon . operations is
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage ( i . e .
grouting another unit and replacing some valves ) . this work will limit our
west deliveries to 875 , 000 . this notice will also be posted shortly .
see me if you have questions
