Subject: highland - pecos irrigation
regarding the subject interconnect , bennie neatherlin / tw operations reported
that the facilities have been sold to duke some time ago . the only thing
that exists on tw system for the subject interconnect is a 4 " side valve that
is disconnected from the measuring facilities . should your prospective
producer want to come to tw at this location , we would need to provide you
with a level " a " cost estimate for new interconnect facilities to connect to
the existing 4 " side valve . tw ' s line pressure at the 4 " side valve would be
near 600 - 650 psig . ( should they be interested in going to duke , their line
pressure is near 400 psig . )
would you like for us to provide you with a cost estimate ? if so , what type
of volumes are proposed and will dehy / production equipment be provided by the
producer ?
