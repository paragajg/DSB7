when we go into production , i think we would want to be similar across the pipes in look and feel for the unsubscribed capacity . we can set up the criteria to in several different ways . please see nng ' s unsubscribed site http : / / www . nng . enron . com / dob / etfr _ avcap . html and click on unsubscribed to view the dropdowns . i would suggest this is the way to go for the tw unsubscribed page . unlike today where the user has to pull the complete page up on tw ' s unsubscribed , this will give the user capability to define what they are looking for . please let me know as soon as possible so rich can set up the format for tw ' s unsubscribed . if you have any questions please let me give me a call 31527 .

we will soon be posting tw ' s unsubscribed capacity to the internet from the new cas system . the cas and edi requirements have been defined ; but we don ' t yet know how the data should be displayed on the internet . should we copy the format from nng ' s long term unsubscribed capacity or from tw ' s current unsubscribed capacity ?
