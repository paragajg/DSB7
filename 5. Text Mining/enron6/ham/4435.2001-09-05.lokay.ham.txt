i ' m with you . if we can ' t make money , why enter into an agreement ? the team at canadian is under the impression that they are going to be asked to run the units long term . not sure where this is coming from .
i think there are probably better places to put the units .

i understand that there has been a request to run two units at this location beginning thursday . is this a long term commitment ? i ' ve been told that the units will need some work at some point if we expect them to operate on a daily basis .

mike flynn - canadian team : these units are candidates for abandonment . what day were each of these units last run ? if they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority . if we run them , however , it postpones the abandonment - under - automatic - blanket - authority option by another year . please let me know asap . steve
