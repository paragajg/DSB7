ladies and gentlemen ,
the reason larry contacted us for this work is because we have two people in
our office who are on the navajo nation ' s list of certified botanists ( phil
hackney and jon alstad ) . both of them worked on the san juan lateral and
the looping project that was done in the early ' 90 s in arizona . however ,
preliminary indications are that the navajos might still require us to get a
new permit to do the work , anyway . we have left a message with the navajo
natural heritage program to determine whether we can circumvent their
" minimum of two weeks " turn around time of receiving a " project - specific , "
" site - specific " permit for conducting the surveys , if they are going to
require a new permit . in the event that they are unwilling to expedite the
permit to us , it may be two weeks before we can mobilize . we are attempting
to convince them that because our botanists are on their list , we should
receive an expedited permit . i will keep you posted on our progress .

i recently received a call from the epa in san francisco and was informed
that the agency will not issue the air permits for the turbines or allow
any pipe to be placed into the ground at stations 3 and 4 untill an
endangered species survey is completed at each facility . in leau of this
new surprise and in an attempt to complete all permits and approvals in a
timely manner ahead of the construction , i have contacted ensr a consulting
firm out of ft . collins , colorado to do the survey for plants and animals at
each location . expect a call from them early next week . i would think
that the survey time at each facility will only take approx . 3 - 4 hours and
they will be out of your hair . please extend every courtesy to them .
