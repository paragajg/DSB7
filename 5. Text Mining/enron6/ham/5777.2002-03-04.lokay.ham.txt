lindy ,
since socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle , this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled . also , i know socal confirms the needles point via edi . will they also confirm this socal topock point via edi ? if they do confirm via edi , it would be good to have them work with mary draemer on a test edi file . will they give us a window like they do at socal needles ?
today in tms , we do have a non grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7 : 30 am . i know socal does not confirm this cycle today for needles . also , currently in production today socal needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation . this topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via edi . socal will need to complete the operator choice request form that is posted on the tw web site .
thanks ramona

here ' s a simple first draft . i didn ' t know how much detail we should get into .
ramona , am i using the correct terminology ? they are not going to confirm in cycle 1 . they are just going to let us fill - in where el paso filled - up all the capacity downstream .

let me know your comments .
thanks !
