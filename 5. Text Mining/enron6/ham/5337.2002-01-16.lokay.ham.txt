ferc ' s approval came after the ferc staff , and the staffs of the california state lands commission and the interior department ' s bureau of land management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement . the commission already had issued a preliminary determination , approving all non - environmental aspects of the project .
if the project " is constructed as modified and in accordance with [ north baja ' s ] proposed mitigation and our recommendations , it would be an environmentally acceptable action , " the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement ( feis ) on the pipeline ( cpol - 22 ) .
