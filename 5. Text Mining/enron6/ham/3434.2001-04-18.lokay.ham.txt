julie - we can assign a centrex line ( 713 - 750 - xxxx ) number for him . i will have to order call notes from swb ( monthly charge ) on this for his voicemail . this will work totally different from the lucent phone with it ' s only feature being call notes . please be sure eric understands this . i ' ll let you know the due date this will all be completed . it will probably be another 5 working days to get the order completed by bell .
let me know if you have any questions . i apologize for the delay . . . this request did not make it to my group .
