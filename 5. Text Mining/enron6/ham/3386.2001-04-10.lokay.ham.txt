i have been in several discussions lately where the statement has been made that waiver of the price cap on capacity release expires in september 2001 . this is incorrect . order 637 states that the commission is waiving the maximum rate ceiling in its capacity release regulations until september 30 , 2002 for short - term releases of capacity of less than one year beginning upon the effective date of this rule .
( i ) waiver of maximum rate ceiling . until september 30 , 2002 , the maximum rate ceiling does not apply to capacity release transactions of less than one year . with respect to releases of 31 days or less under paragraph ( h ) , the requirements of paragraph ( h ) ( 2 ) will apply to all such releases regardless of the rate charged .
