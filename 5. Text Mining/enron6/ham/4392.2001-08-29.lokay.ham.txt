subject : quick update on el paso capacity allocation conference
today ' s technical conference ( rpo 0 - 336 ) was not the snazzy show we perhaps expected . with el paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios , shippers requested four more , showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between cd and full requirements shipper coincidental and non coincidental peaks .
though there were some fr vs . cd shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by
the tx , nm and az fr shippers and aera energy ( cd shippers ) . there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service .
the primary issue here ended up being procedural , with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the commission ( or settlement , though that seems very likely - - merits decision is the most likely case ) .
also never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants proposals that el paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( rpol - 484 and 486 ) .
the procedural schedule has been set :
el paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : sept . 24
initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : oct . 15
reply comments : oct . 26
i ' ll send a more detailed report , but wanted to get the quick info . out to those most interested .
