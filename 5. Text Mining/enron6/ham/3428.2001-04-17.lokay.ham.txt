Subject: archiving unsubscribed capacity
i spoke with perry frazier this afternoon . i have a copy in my file of the unsubscribed capacity on our ebb prior to the sale of tw space to mavrix and a copy of the sheet post - mavrix [ yes the space was posted ] . perry is printing the capacity sheets daily ( sometimes ) .
as a backup , michelle lokay will also do a daily print for years 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 . the pages will be kept in a log book on the tw marketing desk for future reference .
let me know if you have questions .
thanks
