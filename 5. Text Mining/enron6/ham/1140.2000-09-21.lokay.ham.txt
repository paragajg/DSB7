climate prediction center winter outlook
?
? ? ? the climate prediction center , a unit of the national oceanic and
atmospheric administration , discusses the outlook for this winter . the
agency does not expect el nino and la nina to affect global weather for the
next nine months . the two weather patterns , which occur because of changes
in ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean , directly influence us rain
patterns and land temperatures . the cpc says this winter will be the first
year in three that the us has not had a strong influence from this
particular climate - driving force . but , that does not mean there will be a
whole lot of difference in terms of when winter will start . it will have
something to do with temperatures , because both la nina and el nino have
tended to make temperatures moderate in the winter . ? the cpc expects that
this winter nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal ,
but not as warm as the last three . the northern part of the nation and
particularly the northeast , however , could be an exception with colder
weather . the warmer pattern will be confined more to the west and the south .
east of the mississippi with the exception of florida should be cooler this
winter and most of california and the northern half of the rockies and the
dakotas . for the fall and winter , expect the southwest to be the mild and
dry .
