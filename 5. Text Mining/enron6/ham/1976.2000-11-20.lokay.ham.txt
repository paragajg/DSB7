thanks again for your help on getting the well connected asap . for the
weekend , we estimate we will be flowing around 34 , 000 mmbtu / day .
we have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy ' s to allow for greater
production .
hopefully this flow will continue for awhile .
we are selling the production at the interconnect , hopefully tw is getting
a good transport rate . earlier today , i could have paid tw $ 4 . 00 / mmbtu
transport , got any ft ? $ 10 . 50 at the border , $ 5 . 50 at tw . makes your ft
west shippers rich .
i know we have had numerous discussions with gas control , michelle , field
people , etc . tell everyone thanks for the hard work .
