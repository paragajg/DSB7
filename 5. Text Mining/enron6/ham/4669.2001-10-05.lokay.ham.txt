weakening demand to put the squeeze on spot refining margins
oil demand growth is slowing dramatically in the aftermath of the september 11
terrorist attacks . the combination of sluggish gdp growth and a sharp decrease
in commercial air travel will in cera ' s view result in declines in quarterly
oil demand in fourth quarter 2001 and first quarter 2002 . spot refining margins
are expected to trend downward , with the possibility of periods of upward
volatility . key factors that will influence the path of margins for the balance
of this year and into 2002 include
* weakening supply - demand fundamentals , as weak economies and reduced
commercial air travel drive down demand
* opec production policy and its effect on inventory levels
* supply security concerns , including perceived risks of disruptions to
physical supply that could result from new attacks or military action
* * end * *
