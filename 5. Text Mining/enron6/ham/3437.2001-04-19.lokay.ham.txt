importance : high
the march rate needs to be updated for the path wot ( poi 500179 ) to eot . the rate system still reflects $ 0 . 0075 for this path rather than the calculated rate of $ 0 . 0121 . once this is done , please notify one of the schedulers to reverse and rebook for both february and march . if anyone has questions , please let me know .
thanks ,
elizabeth

to : elizabeth brown / et however , this rate was not changed for the other primary path wot to eot and was billed at the base rate of $ 0 . 0075 . this is an additional $ 10 , 305 that will need to billed to usgt .
these amounts should fall in line with what usgt was expecting ( other than for differences due to rounding of the rates to four decimal places ) . someone in your group will need to update these rates in cbs and notify the scheduler to reverse and rebook for both months .
please let me know if you need anything further .
thanks ,
elizabeth

elizabeth ,
apparently usgt disagrees with our invoice ( the $ 10 , 000 mistake works in our favor ) . is there a way you could take a look at this ( or at least help me to do it ) in order to reconcile ? usgt also believes our february invoice is wrong . call me . thanks .

dear jeff :
here is a breakdown of my calculation for the amount we owe on contract
# 27161 for march 2001 .
400 , 000 * . 0075 * . 31 = $ 93 , 000 . 00 demand charge
394 , 160 * . 1425 = $ 56 , 167 . 80 socal needles deliveries
87 , 039 * . 1425 = $ 12 , 403 . 06 pg & e topock deliveries
3 , 187 , 186 * . 0093 = $ 29 , 640 . 83 east deliveries
total of $ 191 , 211 . 69
please let me know if you have any questions or if you disagree with the
above calculations .
thanks ,
leslie
