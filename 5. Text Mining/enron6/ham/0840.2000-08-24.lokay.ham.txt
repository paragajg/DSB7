subject : revised transportation proposal
hi ed - here is a revised comprehensive summary of the firm transportation
proposal between red cedar and transwestern :
term : 5 years , january 1 , 2001 through december 31 , 2005
year volume rate ( + option fee )
1 125 , 000 mmbtu / d * $ 0 . 02 / mmbtu / d
2 150 , 000 mmbtu / d $ 0 . 025 / mmbtu / d
3 150 , 000 mmbtu / d $ 0 . 03 / mmbtu / d
4 150 , 000 mmbtu / d $ 0 . 035 / mmbtu / d
5 150 , 000 mmbtu / d $ 0 . 04 / mmbtu / d
option : red cedar shall have a one - time option to reduce its contract mdq
for contract years 4 - 5 to a volume between 100 , 000 mmbtu / d - 150 , 000
mmbtu / d . red cedar may trigger this option anytime before november 30 ,
2003 . option fee is an incremental one - tenth of one cent / mmbtu ( additive to
the above quoted rates ) over the five year term .
facility modifications : the current cost estimate to increase the meter
capacity ( from 200 , 000 mmbtu / d to 300 , 000 mmbtu / d ) at the arkansas loop plant
into transwestern is $ 378 , 000 . * year 1 capacity of 125 , 000 mmbtu is
dependent upon the completion of these facility modifications . red cedar
will fund these facility modifications ( by a one - time payment of $ 378 , 000
payable prior to transwestern ordering material for the modifications ) . in
order to avoid the tax gross - up of approximately $ 130 , 000 , the $ 378 , 000 will
be amortized over the term of the contract and booked as " pre - paid "
transportation fees . ( the net effect of this will be zero because the slight
increase / mmbtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will
be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre - paid transportation . )
please call me to discuss . thanks .
