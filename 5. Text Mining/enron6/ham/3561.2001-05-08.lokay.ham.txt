Subject: red rock - newark group
the newark group has withdrawn its bid for 800 mmbtu / d needles expansion . ( after looking at the contract i sent to them , it appears their lawyers had red - lined the entire agreement and that for such a small volume it wasn ' t worth it ! ) not a big deal , but how should we proceed with awarding the 800 / d ? i think bp would take it or maybe oneok . what do ya ' ll think ?
