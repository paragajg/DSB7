new mexico train de - railment - most of this week was spent helping customers
re - route gas as the train derailment on tw ' s right - of - way in mckinley county ,
new mexico forced operations to blow down the mainline in the east of thoreau
area . the accident reduced flow to the california border by 250 , 000 mmbtu / d
or 25 % . once the 27 rail cars were removed , a determination was made that
line would need to be hydro - tested to ensure no damage had occurred .
approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated , the coating inspected and / or
replaced , and if test results are good , the line should be back in service
sometime during the weekend of november 3 . while the pipe is being recoated ,
the line segment will only operate at 80 % of maximum pressure . tw costs and
revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from
burlington and / or enron business interruption insurance .
