Subject: eog material
i understand that eog transferred the funds yesterday , 8 - 13 - 01 , for the
material for the eog pronghorn interconnect . this memo is so that we are
all on the same page .
re : building - i called abbott building company yesterday and told them
that enron is releasing the building to eog . i talked with mike abbott
about when they could deliver the building and he said , " we can deliver it
in the morning if you want . " so , i gave him the phone numbers for dirk
ellyson to get directions and further instructions .
re : equipment for inside the building - i talked with don pitts yesterday ,
as well as , mel mayes and ernie de los santos . i told don we could deliver
the material to his office or to the site and he said they really weren ' t
ready for it quite yet . mel mayes , who will be doing the wiring and
electrical work for eogresources , agreed that he didn ' t want to have to work
around all the equipment laying in the building . so , ernie , of the cdc
group in roswell , has agreed to deliver the equipment to the site when eog
is ready for it , which should be sometime next week .
