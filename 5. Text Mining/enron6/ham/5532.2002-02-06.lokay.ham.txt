Subject: tw top ten - browncover
attached is the tw top ten shippers by revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the browncover report .
note :
total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $ 180 . 9 m . the amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $ 165 . 9 m .
this difference is mainly due to the following :

$ 2 . 7 m - socal rate issue - $ not collected
$ 1 . 8 m - additional month of pge revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $ collected
revenues for these customers were adjusted according .
