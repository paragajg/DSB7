Subject: tw / conoco at wt - 1
this is to respond to your question on tw / conoco at w - 1 . if conoco has a line close to wt - 1 or they are able to tie to wt - 1 , i would recommend that they should tie their line to discharge side of the wt - 1 compressor station and not to the suction . a similar case was recommended to duke a couple of months ago . the line pressure at discharge side of wt - 1 is 1008 psig .
