enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive metro bus passes or woodlands express passes . you may pick up a bus pass from the parking & transportation desk , on level 3 of the enron building , from 8 : 30 am to 4 : 30 pm .
all metro passes offered through the enron parking & transportation desk will be the metro 30 day zone pass . when you use a 30 - day zone pass , bus service is divided into four zones w / unlimited rides . the zone pass is time activated , which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time . new passes will be available to enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period . each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels . this is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher - cost zone than the zone pass they have , in this case the difference must be paid in cash . if they are traveling in a lower cost zone , then there is no extra cost .
