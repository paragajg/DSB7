pg & e corp . announced that its national energy group will develop its first
nevada project , a 1 , 000 mw natural gas - fired generating plant to be located
45 miles northeast of las vegas . the merchant plant ' s main purpose is to
supply nevada , but when it is not needed there , it will add much - needed
supply to the western energy market . the group hopes to begin construction
during the fourth quarter of 2001 , with completion expected in early 2004 .
" southern nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the
country , " said thomas b . king , president of pg & e neg , west region . " because
of its location near las vegas , the meadow valley project will be ideally
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth . " including the nevada
project , pg & e national energy group has a total of 4 , 000 mw in development or
construction in california , oregon , nevada and arizona .
