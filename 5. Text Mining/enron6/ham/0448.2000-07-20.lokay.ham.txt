Subject: updated : interactive open season ready for testing
we have moved another change into production where any bid equal to over the
max rate will be valued using a 0 % throughput commitment . this way , any one
part and two part bid over max rate will be evaluated in the same manner .
this also means that when a user checks the max rate button , a 0 % throughput
commitment will be assumed .
