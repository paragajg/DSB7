michelle ,
?
i called the brookside country club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs . ? unfortunately , they do not have clubs to rent out . ?
they suggested , if possible , you borrow a set from a friend . ?
?
i ' m not sure if renting from a friend is possible , but i do have a set
of clubs you could borrow . ? they aren ' t the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age , but i would be glad to let you borrow them . ?
please give me a call if you are interested and i will bring them to the
golf outing .
?
