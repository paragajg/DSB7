importance : high
there is a great concern from tw planning / marketing that the existing cas system is not responding to our expectations .
while we have corrected numerous bugs in the program , getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow .
this has caused a delay from facility planning to the marketing group . lets plan to talk about some new features that marketing
has requested for the cas system . pipeline facility planning is arranging a meeting on friday feb - 1 from 2 to 3 : 30 pm in
room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues .
regards ,
