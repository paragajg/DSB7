fundamentals have taken center stage , as building demand pressure accompanies
us supply declines . storage inventories have been significantly reduced , and
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into
the summer months . demand - driven growth continues , as completions of
gas - fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10 , 000 megawatts
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand . the result is a
higher - price playing field for natural gas , with the average henry hub price
likely to reach $ 3 . 67 per mmbtu for 2000 - - its highest level since the
development of spot markets .
