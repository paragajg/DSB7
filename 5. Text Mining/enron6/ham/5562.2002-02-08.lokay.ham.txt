Subject: power outage at enron building
wednesday afternoon febuary 6 th , 2002 , the enron building experienced a brief power outage . the building is powered by one of two reliant circuits . yesterday , while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system , the primary circuit failed . typically , the backup system would have switch on immediately , but because the backup circuit was off the building ' s backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke . while there was no fire within the building , many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell . given heighten concerns for national security , evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously .
