western energy monthly briefing :
prices remain high and volatile
winter arrived with a bang last week , and the wild ride
in western gas and power markets continues . the early
cold together with maintenance outages on pipelines and
power plants , strong pulls on gas , and low storage
inventories pushed gas prices to new highs .
* topock prices pushed over $ 10 . 00 per million british
thermal units ( mmbtu ) in mid - november , with sumas and
malin hitting $ 8 . 00 . these price run - ups are likely to
continue .
* the pipeline - constrained topock and malin markets will
see swings from $ 6 . 00 to $ 12 . 00 per mmbtu on a week - to -
week - basis .
* november ' s cold snap demonstrated what cera has
anticipated : continued power price strength and
volatility during the year due to gas and power market
supply tightness .
* * end * *
