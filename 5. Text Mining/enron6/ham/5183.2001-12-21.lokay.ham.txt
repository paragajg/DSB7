>

>
> husband 1 . 0 should then automatically run the applications guilty 3 . 0 and
> flowers 7 . 0 . but remember , overuse can cause husband 1 . 0 to default to
> grumpy silence 2 . 5 , happy hour 7 . 0 , or beer 6 . 1 . beer 6 . 1 is a very bad
> program that will create snoring loudly . wav files .
>
> do not install mother - in law 1 . 0 or reinstall another boyfriend
> program . these are not supported applications and will crash husband 1 . 0 .
>
> in summary , husband 1 . 0 is a great program , but it does have a
