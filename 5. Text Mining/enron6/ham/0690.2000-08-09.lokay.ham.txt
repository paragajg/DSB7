Subject: operator imbalances
richard , i took the liberty of reformatting your imbalance spreadsheet a
little to be able to sort the numbers by volume and dollar amount ( see
attached ) .
as you update the numbers , would you please send the info to all market team
members as well ( see above ) . we want to be more proactive in managing the
imbalances and staying on top of those operator / shippers that are gaming tw .
thanks
