Subject: pnm capacity : rehearing request
today the commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in
the pnm capacity docket . as you recall , we asked for rehearing of the
commission ' s requirement that tw ' s acquisition of capacity be limited to the
summer months . the tolling order is simply ferc ' s way of buying time to
consider our request . in the absence of commission action within 30 days of
our rehearing request , our request would have been deemed denied . . . so we ' re
doing well so far . there is no deadline for the commission to act on our
request . i ' ll watch to see whether it appears on the commission ' s agenda .
