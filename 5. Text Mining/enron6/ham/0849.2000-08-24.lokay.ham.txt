subject : bid week back - up
kevin - would you like to join me and michelle when i go over the contract
generation process for this next bid week period ? i think you would find it
interesting in terms of better understanding the range of responsibilities i
have which are associated with the contract generation , documentation and
especially discount letter generation . also , starting immediately , there
will be an additional step required for the purposes of 637 posting
requirements which michelle will need to be familiar with in addition to
these other back - up responsibilities . i will be in a derivative training
class next tuesday and wednesday , the primary days when a few tk deals will
be needing to be processed . i can either meet with you and michelle this
friday or next monday . thanks .
