title : monthly gas briefing : a shift in the wind
url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 prices could still rebound quickly with cold weather .
* storage inventories , though still well into record low territory , are higher
than was expected and feared earlier this winter , and the prospect of
inventory
levels that would test overall system reliability and cause widespread
curtailments of firm services appears less and less likely .
* for march , occasional weather - driven price spikes may still occur , but in
the
context of prices settling toward a level just adequate to keep a necessary
amount of demand out of the gas market . this pattern should result in an
average price of $ 6 . 50 per mmbtu at the henry hub .
