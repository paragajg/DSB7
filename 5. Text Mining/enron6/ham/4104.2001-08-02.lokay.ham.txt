yes , it does mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we can contract for on pnm - - however , we have to use the capacity in accordance with our tariff and rates meaning if the pnm capacity is subject to recall ( which i thought was the commission ' s concern in the pnm order last year ) then we can ' t use that capacity to sell firm service ( not subject to recall ) on our system . i don ' t think we are relieved of our reporting requirements either that were required in the pnm order . maria - - please comment if you think i have interpreted this incorrectly .

just in case you didn ' t hear , both nng and tw received approval to acquire third party capacity . the orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them . if you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff , send me a note back and i can get it to you . we specifically didn ' t limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used - - in tw ' s tariff , we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of pnm capacity that could be purchased . thanks for your help with this .
