until advised , please limit travel and entertainment expenses . if you are required to travel on business , you will need to use your personal credit cards or cash and submit your expenses through the xms expense account system at : https : / / expensexms . enron . com / ewp / . if the use of a personal credit card to cover your travel needs is not an option , cash advances can be approved by your immediate supervisor , and processed through your local administrative team . in houston , all cash advance requests , after obtaining proper approval , should be routed to carolyn centilli for processing .
