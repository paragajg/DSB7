Subject: enervest ( k 24568 ) and ena ( k 24654 ) december invoices
i took a look at the two invoices and there should be no changes . because no gas flowed under these contracts for december , all that we could bill is the max reservation rate plus applicable surcharges ( rather than the contracted daily rate of $ 0 . 2175 and $ 0 . 2200 ) .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
thanks ,
elizabeth
