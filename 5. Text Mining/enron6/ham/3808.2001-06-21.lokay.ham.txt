Subject: re : tw agreements
hi michelle !
i am assuming that , like most it agreements , we can put a base agreement in
place and then negotiate short - term discounts when available from time to
time ( last time i talked to t . k . about this capacity it was discounted to
like a penny or 1 . 5 pennies ) ? one of the reasons that we ' ve never gotten
anything accomplished here is that we alway ' s seem to be doing in the middle
of bid - week .
so , if we can , i ' d like bryan to work with you immediately to begin the base
agreement processing . ok ?
thanks !
scott
