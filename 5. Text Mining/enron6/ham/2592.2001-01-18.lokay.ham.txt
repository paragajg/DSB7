Subject: gas transportation
dave :
attached is a proposal for firm transportation services that provide economic
incentives to encourage sps to build a lateral from the nichols plant in
potter co , tx to our transwestern panhandle lateral .
as we have discussed , the proposal allows flexibility for receipt and
delivery , yet provides rate assurance .
thanks for your help , and if you have any questions please give me or
michelle a call .
sincerly ,
bob
