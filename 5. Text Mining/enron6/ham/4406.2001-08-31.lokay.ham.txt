western energy markets : new power plants soothe the market
roughly 5 , 000 mw of new generating capacity in 2001 has helped dampen price
pressures and stem reliability concerns in california and the west . new plant
plus significantly reduced summer demand through conservation has put the
west ' s capacity margin at 15 percent , but regional balances vary widely . power
demand declines have also completely relieved the west coast gas supply
shortfall . despite low hydroelectric output , gas demand for power generation in
the west is actually down from last year .
* energy conservation in response to the retail price increase , cool weather ,
and the slowing economy is the strongest fundamental driver in california .
* new power supplies have arrived , but grid operators cannot count on full
nameplate capacity within the first few months of a new plant ' s start date .
* pacific northwest hydroelectric resources remain critically low despite low
demand , raising the specter of reliability problems this winter .
* * end * *
