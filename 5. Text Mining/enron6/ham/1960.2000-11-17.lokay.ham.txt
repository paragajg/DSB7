Subject: tw expansion
e prime would have interest in the following expansion plans :
1 . creating a cunningham / maddox connection directly from the linam plant :
dave engbrock ( 303 - 308 - 6002 ) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments .
2 . increasing the cig / tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40 , 000 to
60 , 000 : during the summer , e prime flowed up to 15 , 000 from cig into tw ' s
pepl pool ; if this capacity were expanded , we might be able to get more
supply off cig . the problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25 , 000 due to operational reasons , and that was not
enough room for all shippers . any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to california , or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the waha area .
3 . e prime would be interested in 10 , 000 / d of capacity from nw pipeline to
socal topock - - term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years , rate would be the
maximum rate .
if you have any additional questions , please feel free to contact me at
303 - 308 - 6072 .
