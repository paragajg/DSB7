Subject: ferc approves pg & e nw it allocation procedure
quick change in pg & e nw it allocation
within hours of a ferc vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its
interruptible transportation ( it ) queue , pg & e gas transmission northwest
announced new procedures effective today .
the commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted
pg & e nw ' s tariff sheets as of oct . 25 , saying the revisions were " generally
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation
procedures . "
under the revised tariff pg
if there are more confirmed it nominations from shippers all paying the
maximum rate , then it capacity will be allocated pro - rata to the confirmed
nominations . ~ for example , if the capacity constraint were at station 14 , a
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from stanfield to
malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed
nomination at the maximum rate for service from kingsgate to malin .
second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then
the maximum rate . the discounted / negotiated it space will be allocated on
highest to lowest total revenue ( rate x mileage ) . ~ for example , a shipper
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per dth of $ 0 . 11
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for
service with a total revenue of $ 0 . 10 , regardless of the path nominated .
discounted it shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations . "
