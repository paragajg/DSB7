here ' s the other epng news flash . . . apparently , epng is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system . i ' m assuming at this point this project will include the all american pipeline asset .
i ' m also now told that the kern river expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago . we heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 mmcf / d expansion that would include the 124 mmcf / d expansion already sold . new information suggests that the 500 mmcf / d expansion may be significantly understated , and volumes may approach 700 - 800 mmcf / d . the expansion would include not only compression , but would involve additional pipe , and would not be rolled into existing rates , but would be an incrementally priced project .
