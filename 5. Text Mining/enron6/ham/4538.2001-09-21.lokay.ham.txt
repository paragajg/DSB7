Subject: fw : bloomfield to gallup pigging
fyi - i spoke with john sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the sj lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase . he says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe . if the efficiency of the sj lateral does not increase from the pig run , then operations will look to reapply the dra .

to recap past conversations , bloomfield to gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last february . it is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig . if this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity , re - application of the dra will be considered .
how does pigging bloomfield to gallup the first week in october sound ? darrell pointed out that would provide a week ' s run time on the gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for september 29 .
i suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig . the afternoon of monday , october 1 , a conference call would be held . if there were no complications with gallup or any other issues , the pig run would be scheduled for wednesday or thursday .
if you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions , please let me know . also please let me know if having the conference call at 2 : 00 p . m . , cst , monday , october 1 , would work for you , and if not , then what time would be good . i will plan on sending out the conference number and code next monday , september 24 .
thanks ,
john
