did you see the following in the gas daily today ?
calif . approves calpine plant
the california energy commission on monday
gave the final go - ahead for calpine to begin con - struction
on its 600 - mw , natural gas - fired metcalf
energy center in san jose , the company said .
the approval follows a two - and - a - half year
battle against local interests opposed to the proj - ect ,
which will be located in power - hungry silicon
valley . calpine is partnering with bechtel enter - prises
to build the plant .
the initial tide of local opposition was finally
turned by widespread support for the proposed
facility from state energy agencies , gov . gray davis
and environmental groups . san jose ' s city council
had initially refused to give zoning approval for the
facility but changed tack after the groundswell of
statewide support and the seriousness of the
state ' s energy shortage became apparent .
" we have always believed this is an ideal
location for a plant , in a region without its own
local source of significant power generation , " ken
abreu , general manager for joint development for
the companies , said in a statement .
calpine and bechtel will begin construction
next month , with the start of commercial opera - tions
set for the second half of 2003 .
