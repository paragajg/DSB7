Subject: over 7 . 5 bcf / d sendout in california
take a look at the california send out numbers for 11 / 15 and 11 / 16 . we ' re
really pushing the envelope here . collectively , socal and pg & e are having to
withdraw over 2 bcf / d in order to meet demand . this situation is precisely
what we ' ve predicted would happen in a gas short marketplace . look for this
shortage to be exacerbated in the next few years with the addition of the new
eoc power plants , particularly , when the power is most likely going to be
used to serve native markets , not the cal . iso / px with its " price cap "
feature .
