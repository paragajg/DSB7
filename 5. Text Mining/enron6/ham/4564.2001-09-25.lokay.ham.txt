weak oil fundamentals weighing on price
two forces are vying for control of oil market psychology since september 11 - -
fear of recession and fear of military action . currently , the fear of recession
and its implications for oil demand is in ascendance because military action
remains in preparatory mode thus far .
* an escalation of military action would revive the initial concerns that a us
military response could affect production in the middle east .
* the terrorist attack of september 11 is delivering a shock to the us economy
with ramifications in the oil market . cera has revised downward sharply its
demand outlook in the wake of the attacks .
* opec producers are also growing more concerned about market share . our
outlook assumes that opec does not agree to a further cut at its september 26
meeting in vienna .
* * end * *
