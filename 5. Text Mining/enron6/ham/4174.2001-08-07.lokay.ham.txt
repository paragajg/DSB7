Subject: oneok letter
attached is a revised draft of a letter as we would like to see it from oneok , which includes changes from the draft michelle and i crafted on friday . while we don ' t intend to provide this draft to oneok , it will enable us to assist them if they ask for drafting suggestions ( they will more than likely be on a short time fuse ) . please let me know if either of you has any comments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tony
