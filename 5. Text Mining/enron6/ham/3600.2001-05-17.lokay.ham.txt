Subject: wild goose storage open season and the ruby pipeline
this note is to remind you of the may 22 deadline for
indicating your interest in booking capacity at an expanded wild goose gas
storage facility .
we also wish to inform you that aec has now decided to
participate in a group that is examining the feasibility of the ruby
pipeline , which is being proposed by colorado interstate gas to serve the
western united states . the proposed ruby line would have a capacity of 750
million cubic feet per day and deliver gas from wyoming to northern
california with a connection to the wild goose storage facility . the
addition of a large new pipeline in this region would also offer wild goose
storage customers a more liquid trading hub in the heart of the volatile
california gas market . aec ' s preliminary assessment of this proposed project
is that it provides a very competitive means of delivering additional supply
flexibility into california from the growing u . s . rockies production basin .
if you have any questions about the specifics of the opportunities to ship
gas on the ruby pipeline , please call ed miller at ( 719 ) 520 - 4305 and tom
dobson at ( 719 ) 520 - 4606 with colorado interstate gas or if you have
questions about obtaining capacity at wild goose , please call either ben
ledene with wild goose storage at ( 403 ) 266 - 8192 , or chris price at ( 530 )
525 - 0490 and mark baldwin at ( 925 ) 243 - 0350 with interstate gas services .
as we all plan to serve the growing california energy
market , we encourage you to consider all the marketing opportunities
available to you by having a strong gas storage position at an expanded wild
goose .
