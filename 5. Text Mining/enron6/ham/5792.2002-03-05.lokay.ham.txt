jeanette :
i just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the global settlement . one of your slides stated that the
tcr surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the global settlement , even if the cfs ' s contract expires .
conoco contract nos . 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of february . i assume we should bill the tcr
surcharge for these contracts beginning in march , 2002 . please let me know if this is correct .
thanks !
