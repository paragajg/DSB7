news : ferc approves independence , supplylink projects
2 : 00 pm ( cst ) jul 12 , 2000
after submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent
agreements
for firm transportation capacity , the highly contested independence pipeline
and related
supplylink pipeline projects were approved by ferc this morning . the two
projects
have been pending at ferc for more than three years .
the ferc decision paves the way for more than 900 mmcf / d of new natural gas
transportation capacity to be built between chicago and the leidy hub in
pennsylvania .
the " tentative " in - service date for the projects is november 2002 . their
downstream
partner , marketlink , which was approved by ferc in april , is expected to be
operating
a year earlier , a williams cos . spokesman said . williams , coastal , and
national
fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects , which together represent an
investment
of about $ 1 . 5 billion .
the commission approved the " greenfield " independence project over
significant
opposition from landowners in ohio and pennsylvania , who recently said they
were not
convinced the new precedent agreements provided " sufficient evidence " of
market
support . the agreements met ferc ' s requirement for the projects to have at
least 35 %
of their total capacity subscribed by non - affiliates by june 26 .
