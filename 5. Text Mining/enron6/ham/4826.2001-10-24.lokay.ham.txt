Subject: jeff mcmahon named cfo
today we announced the appointment of jeff mcmahon as enron ' s chief financial officer . in my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today , it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence . jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of enron . he is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us . andy fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company .
jeff had been serving as chairman and ceo of enron industrial markets . he joined enron in 1994 and spent three years in the london office as chief financial officer for enron ' s european operations . upon returning to the u . s . , jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for enron corp . in 2000 , he was named president and chief operating officer of enron net works .
i know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price . i am too , and we are working very hard to turn it around . appointing jeff as cfo is one important step in that process . but most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence . the fundamentals of our business are strong , and i think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform .
please join me in giving jeff your full support , and thank you for all of your continued hard work .
