Subject: edison mission energy
this project , of all that have been proposed recently , probably has a better
chance of success . first , mission energy is already a huge player in the
ipp / cogen business in kern county , and is regarded as fairly skilled at
getting permits / authorizations through the system . their existing facilites
on texaco ' s leases currently produce over 1 , 000 mw of power . secondly , this
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the midway - sunset field and is
easily accessible off the west side lateral of kern / mojave ' s system . as
such , they are probably a prime candidate for either phase i or phase ii of
kern river ' s expansion . also , realize that texaco has a substantial amount
of field area [ associated oil ] gas , so , depending on the structure of the
texaco - mission energy sales agreement , mission probably has access to or
call on this texaco production ( i . e . , they have the perfect physical hedge ) .
kern would seem to be the " pipeline of choice " here . . . particularly , when you
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion .
without the direct connection into kern county , tw would have a difficult
time competing . also , keep an eye out for el paso moving forward with
commercial plans for the california leg of all american pipeline . a large
end - use plant like this could be the basis for an " en - rate " type transport
program on el paso - all american , particularly if they get their allocation
problems resolved at ferc .

proposed power generation facility to be located in kern county , calif . , the
project will bring both short - and long - term generation capacity to the
state , which is in dire need of new power generation .
the sunrise power project will be completed in two phases . phase 1 will
consist of a 320 - mw , simple - cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001 . phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560 - mw , combined - cycle operation with an in - service date of summer
2003 .
final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for phase i of the
project . edison mission energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the phase ii expansion in line with the fast - track approvals process
recently enacted by the california legislature .
edison mission energy specializes in the development , acquisition ,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities .
the company owns nearly 23 , 000 mw of generating capacity , including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
