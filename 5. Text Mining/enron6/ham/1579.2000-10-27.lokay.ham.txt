rather than enjoying a respite , western energy markets will make november
a catch - up month . natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year , as gas - fired generation will continue to run at
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels . the tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices , which will range from $ 5 . 15 to $ 5 . 83 per million british thermal
units , depending on location . refueling outages at three nuclear units , along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output , will maintain gas - fired
generation on the margin for most of november . on - peak power prices will
remain higher as a result , in the $ 86 - $ 98 per megawatt - hour range ,
depending on location .
