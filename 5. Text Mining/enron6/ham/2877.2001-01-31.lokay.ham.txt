we ' ve been asked to go back to the shippers and secure two ( 2 ) bids on the capacity . ask your shippers to look at the term sheet and give us a bid on ( 1 ) the [ original ] 30 % sharing mechanism on alternate west flows , and ( 2 ) a 50 % sharing mechanism on alternate west flows . let them know we realize that the 50 % sharing mechanism will likely result in a reduced reservation rate , however , we ' d like to see both " looks " at the deal . also , whether we choose the structure with a 30 % sharing , or the 50 % sharing , let them know that we ' ll make our decision on best bid [ on friday ] based on the highest npv of reservation bid .
