Subject: thank you !
gina , this one is going to enron transportation services - houston
i want to take a moment to say " thank you " to all the employees who
participated in the ets food & toy drive . we delivered over 10 boxes of food
and toys on friday to the downtown location of the head start program .
there are many people in the houston community who need our help and support ,
especially during the holiday season . through your kindness , the head start
program , ets ' adopted united way agency , will be able to help those less
fortunate .
the pictures below capture some of our employees displaying the donations
that were collected in the enron building . the collections in three allen
center were significant as well .
thank you , again , for your overwhelming generosity .
