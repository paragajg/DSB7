Subject: management announcement
as you are all aware , ebs has grown to be a significant part of enron . the
ebs / blockbuster movies on - demand announcement this week , as merrill lynch put
it ,  & confirms the tremendous inroads enron has made in the telecommunications
business .  8 we expect this deal to be a springboard for enabling ebs to
accomplish even greater things .
because we believe that ebs is integral to enron  , s success , it is becoming
increasingly important for greater interaction among ebs senior management ,
corporate leadership and our houston - based business units . in short , we
determined that it is necessary for the ceo to be based in houston , although
the portland office will remain an integral part of ebs .
joe hirko as ceo and ken rice as chief commercial officer have accomplished
great things , and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the
ceo role moving forward . however , joe has decided to stay in portland for
family reasons , and as a result , ken will assume the role of ceo for ebs ,
effective immediately .
joe , unfortunately , has decided to leave enron . we want to recognize joe for
his role in making ebs a success . he started the business , demonstrated its
value to enron management , and brought the team together to create the ebs
vision .
we do believe that ebs will continue to grow and succeed under ken  , s
leadership . throughout his 19 - year career with enron , he has consistently
been a driving force in building businesses .
please join us in wishing both joe and ken great success .
