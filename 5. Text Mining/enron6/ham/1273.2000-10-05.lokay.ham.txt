southwest gas - swg informed us this week they will most likely not be ready
to receive gas from tw by the projected november 1 in - service date ; the new
date will probably be mid - month . we will still invoice swg for
transportation under their firm contract beginning nov . 1 . also , upon
inspection this week , tw engineering noticed swg had installed a bypass - valve
on their meter station at the new facility . this bypass was not in the
originally approved drawings . tw ' s policy does not allow for a bypass unless
the customer has a non - interruptible contract . we are waiting for an
explanation from swg and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe .
