Subject: revised form agreement
here is a revised version of the red rock agreement which includes changes suggested by jeff . if you ' ve already sent the previous version to shippers , that is perfectly fine , as jeff ' s changes should be noncontroversial . we ' ve just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper ' s bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement . this new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion .
