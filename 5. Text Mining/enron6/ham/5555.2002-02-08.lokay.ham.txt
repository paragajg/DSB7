i have an issue with this format . when you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up . we have run into this issue before , and that is why we have not put it in frames . we may need to look at another format to cover the on - line users and the customers that print this report . this has been an on going issue on - line when you scroll down you lose the header . the printing customers won ' t think to highly of this format . my suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides ( printing and viewing ) . jeff / perry , we may have to get together and discuss this issue .

please go to http : / / twdev . ets . enron . com our testing site to view the modified tw unsubscribed capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want . i removed the borders because the table header and records page are in the different frames , it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns .
thanks !
