Subject: tw firm contract processing
effective august 16 th , 2001 , the ets deal capture team will help process all firm agreements on tw . all requests for firm service should continue to go to michelle or dennis for the base agreement processing ; however , the marketer should complete and forward a deal sheet ( attached ) for completion of the discount amendment and for us to obtain the appropriate approvals . deal capture will also tender the agreements and hand partially executed deals to contracts for activation . as time permits , we will reconstruct the tw firmbook listing of all active agreements by production month . please let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks !
