Subject: gallup news
good news : i ' ve just received word that the ferc has issued an order denying
socal ' s request for rehearing of the gallup order . ferc also ordered that
tw ' s request for rehearing ( which asked the commission not to require tw to
disclose discounted rates ) is now moot because we filed a discount report at
the time required by section 284 . 7 ( b ) ( 6 ) of the commission ' s rules ( as we
always do ) .
if socal is still feeling vindictive , they can file an appeal in the d . c .
circuit . i believe their window is 60 days . in any event , the pendency of
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate .
if you have any questions , let me know .
