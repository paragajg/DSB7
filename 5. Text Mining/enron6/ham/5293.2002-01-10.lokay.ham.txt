who is the marketer assigned to devon sfs operating ?
devon owed tw $ 161 , 292 . 49 as of 12 / 31 / 01 related to oba contract 21749 . there is one point on this contract ( bilbrey 28 fed 1 ) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day . devon is currently having problems delivering gas into tw which is increasing the imbalance further .
devon has told amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven ' t made a commitment yet . if devon doesn ' t cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point , then we will have to explore other options to get this gas / $ $ $ $ .
amy will continue to follow up with devon and pursue cashing out .
thanks
