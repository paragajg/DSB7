randy - tony has some concerns about the possible ownership of some of the abandoned pipe from the tw system . we had assumed that all of the pipe was either sold or abandoned . tony said that lonnie seemed to have some information about what may still be under ets ' ownership ? we would like to identify exactly what we need to be responsible for so that it can be adequately protected against possible encroachment problems .
thanks ! - weldon
