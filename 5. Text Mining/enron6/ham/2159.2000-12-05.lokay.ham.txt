Subject: tw ebb re - posting
could you replace our recent posting on the ebb with the attached document .
we ' ve just corrected the name of " enron oil & gas " to " eog resources " . i
don ' t think it ' s necessary to put " revised " or anything on it , unless we have
to . i ' d just like to replace it ( or if you can go in and make that change ,
that ' s okay too ) . let me know .
thanks ,
lindy
