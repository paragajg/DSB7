subject : tabletalk session with stan horton
at least once a month , stan likes to meet informally with different parts of
the organization to hear from employees about what ' s going on . during these
tabletalk sessions , stan also shares the latest enron information and answers
employee questions .
please plan to join stan on monday , november 6 , 3 : 30 - 5 : 00 p in eb - 49 c 3 for a
tabletalk session with the tw commercial group group .
ahead of the meeting , steve will get with a few of the tw commercial group
employees to ask them to give stan a short , informal update on what ' s
happening in our group . this will facilitate an open discussion with stan .
at the session , stan will also field any questions you have . if you prefer ,
you can pre - submit your questions for stan to gina taylor .
i hope you ' ll make plans to join stan on november 6 . this is a great
opportunity to " hear it from the top . "
