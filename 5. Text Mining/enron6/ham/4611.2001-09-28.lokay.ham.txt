rob ,
i have some information as it relates to supplying power plants . for instance my ca interstate capacity report includes several interstate pipeline projects intended to serve these plants . kern river has at least 3 projects filed including the high desert lateral project which will serve the high desert power project .
also some time ago i distributed to marketing , regulatory and others a copy of the cec ' s final draft report on california ' s natural gas infrastructure . this report is still not final however a portion of it includes these seven projects as part of the overall demand basis for additional interstate pipeline capacity . virtually the same information was included in the cec ' s presentation at the cpuc ' s own workshop on natural gas infrastructure last april ( jeff f . from marketing also attended workshop ) .
i haven ' t followed these projects individually at the cec however i ' ll call michele to make sure she has the information listed above and ask her if she needs further assistance in obtaining any other pertinent data .
