Subject: enron and united way ' s continued partnership
last month all of your donations helped enron raise a grand total of $ 6 million for the united way , including our corporate match . once again enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in houston . also , congratulations to elaine brown with enron global markets who won the drawing for two round - trip airline tickets for participating in this year ' s campaign . thanks to everyone at enron for your generosity !
this week enron and the united way of the texas gulf coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership . beginning with the astros vs giants game on tuesday , october 2 , one of enron ' s primary signs at enron field will feature the united way logo alongside the enron logo .
the decision to include united way ' s logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in - stadium signage locations with a non - profit partner . this sign is also a free , innovative way to demonstrate enron ' s support of the united way and promote the agency ' s role in our community .
the millions of fans who attend astros games each season will see the sign . be sure to look for this history - making sign hanging high above the outfield .
