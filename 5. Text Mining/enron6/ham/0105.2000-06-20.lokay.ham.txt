subject : tw cash for fuel issues
christine ,
after our meeting last week , john , elizabeth , gerry , richard , dave & i
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process . we had
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows :
regulatory / legal issue : can we have contract specific language on our firm
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel
discount cash option to an acquiring shipper ? if we must offer this
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper .
this will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at
this time .
shipper nomination issue : how will we handle shipper nomination line items
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts ? could we
default these " 02 " overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using
our existing tariff fuel % ? this would make the process of trying to
reconcile the contracted mdq fuel volumes easier when we verify that the
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes
scheduled & paid for in cash . .
tariff sheet issue : when you state in the tariff provision that " the shipper
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a
receipt point on shipper ' s service agreement " does this only apply to the
shipper ' s primary receipt points ?
i would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues . if you feel like
we should meet to discuss , i will be glad to set up another meeting . please
let me know .
thanks ramona
