yes . . . and there are so many choices in that area . . i have bought and
returned 2 types . . . i ' m pushing that we do something . bob martinez gave me
the task of running technical brown bag sessions for upper management to show
them technology . . palm pilot type hardware was what my first session was
going to be on . .

audrey - - the right answer is probably yes i mind . . but , i do not have a
problem with her going and doing it . i understand where she is coming from ,
and i do not like being a road block . do you know what she is planning to
purchase . . . and also she understands we are in the process of selecting a
standard . .

good . . . thank you .
also , we ( gpg ) do not have a standard for palm pilots . . actually , from what
i ' ve found it doesn ' t look like they are leaning towards palm pilots . . can
michelle wait for the standard ? or we can just order her one now . i ' ll
still trying to get a time frame for this standard . i ' l ask again today .
