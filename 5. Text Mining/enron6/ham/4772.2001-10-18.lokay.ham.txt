ferc limits public access to pipe , transmission maps
amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities , the federal energy regulatory commission is limiting the public ' s access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines .
in a statement of policy , the commission said it would " no longer make available to the public " maps of these energy facilities through the internet , the records and information management system ( rims ) and the public reference room at its headquarters in washington , dc .
persons wishing to view the maps , however , can make requests under the freedom of information act ( foia ) at the commission . ferc staff has been urged to " respond timely to legitimate requests " for such documents .
the commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days . the move by ferc was not as drastic as some federal agencies , such as the nuclear regulatory commission , which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution .
given the anthrax scares on capitol hill and elsewhere , a spokeswoman said the commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages .
