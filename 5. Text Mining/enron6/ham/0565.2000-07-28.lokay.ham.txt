Subject: problems with gpg sap news
some of you have had problems with this months newsletter - sorry . the
system we normally use to create it on was down and even though this one was
compatible with the group i test with , it did not work well with everyone .
if you have trouble viewing or printing the format , or just prefer another
format , i have 2 other versions i can send you . just reply to this note or
call me at 713 - 853 - 3986 . if the majority have problems and another version
works , i ' ll resend it to the whole group . for the moment , i ' ll keep working
one - on - one .
thanks ,
donna
