lindy - we receive a report from igs which does track the california
deliveries of kern river . the remaining volumes , and we do assume that kern
river is 100 % full , does get dropped off to the nevada market . sometimes ,
the california deliveries are as low as 325 mmcf / d , which does indicate a
strong las vegas / nevada market demand .

kern river ' s throughput to ca was only 59 % ? did they have an outage ? is the
remaining gas dropping - off before ca ? we usually assume in our gas flows
analysis that kern is 100 % full . this seems unusual .
