Subject: red rock delays
the last " capacity available " analysis that i provided the group assumed that red rock would bring on 120 , 000 mmbtu / d of new west of thoreau capacity beginning june lst . currently , construction delays are expected to result in 80 , 000 mmbtu / d being delayed until june 15 th and 40 , 000 mmbtu / d being delayed until july 15 th . attached is my current estimate of west of thoreau capacity available for june - august . note that if we wanted to begin transport for our contracted shippers on june lst , we would be short of needed capacity by 57 , 298 mmbtu / d junel - 15 and 17 , 298 mmbtu / d julyl - 15 . we need to discuss how this impacts our marketing strategy for june - august capacity .
thanks ,
paul
