Subject: re : conocoprojreqform . xls / monument system
the existing capacity of this system is 38 mmcf / d .
now that we know where the exactl location of the tie - in is and based on your input i have created two flow modeling options for this project : :
option - 1 :
assuming 30 mmcf / d from lanam ranch , the monument station can do another 12 mmcf / d from conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of 42 mmcf / d . if the pressure at lanam ranch reduces , it will change the capacity to a lower figure .
option - 2 :
assuming 0 ( zero ) from lanam ranch , the monument station can handle 62 mmcf / d from conoco at 696 psig pressure .
if the pressure at conoco reduces , it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity .
if you have any comments please e - mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system .

1 ) what is the legal description of this tie - in ?
2 ) what is the maximum pressure that conoco can provide at this point
3 ) if the volume from conoco is going to be 60 mmcf / d , how much gas are you planning to flow from the existing lanam ranch interconnect ( 0 to 30 mmcfd range )
4 ) what is the pressure commitment at lanam ranch
these are required in order to develop a scope / costs for the project .
