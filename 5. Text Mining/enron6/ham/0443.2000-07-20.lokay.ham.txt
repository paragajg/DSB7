Subject: interactive open season ready for testing
the latest changes to the interactive open season application have been moved
into production and are ready for testing . these modifications include :
displaying the actual bids along with the evaluated bids on each of the
detail lines . this will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all
bids greater than max rate .
calculating the winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only ( ignore
time entered ) . a " * " in the first column now means that the bid is a
potential winner , not an actual winner .
forcing shippers to bid on the full volume of the package .
the modifications do not include :
allowing users to supersede any of their own bids greater than or equal to
max rate . because this modification introduces a high risk factor , it will
be made after fiday ' s ios .
because some of these modifications affect the way in which bids are ranked ,
thorough testing by the marketing team should be completed before any
shippers are allowed to enter the system .
