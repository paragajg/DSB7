kern river open season
kern river is holding an open season through aug . 18 to determine interest in
year - round ft to nevada
and california and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm
shippers . the pipeline said it can
offer significantly reduced ft rates based on recent ferc approval of kern
river ' s extended term
rate program ( et program ) . under et program , customers could receive a rate
reduction from $ 0 . 64 / dth
to approximately $ 0 . 42 under a 15 - year contract . because system expansion can
be accomplished by the
addition of compression facilities , it could result in an overall lowering of
rolled - in rates for all shippers , kern
river said . depending on open season results , the pipeline is proposing a
mainline expansion of up to 500
mmcf / d with an in - service target date of may 1 , 2002 . if goals can be met
using relinquished capacity and no
new facilities are required , new service could begin as early as oct . 1 ,
2001 . call laurie brown at
