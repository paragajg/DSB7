over the years , enron federal credit union has been proud to share the enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world . here are some of the exciting changes slated for the credit union in the coming months .
new name
we believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization . our new name will reflect everything that we stand for : trustworthiness , outstanding service , innovative products , value and convenience . you can expect to hear about our official new name later this month .
expanded field of membership
also , being a single sponsor credit union for enron corp . , it has become necessary to expand our field of membership . we continue to welcome and serve current enron employees and their families , but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live , work or worship in downtown houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our credit union .
additional location
another immediate area of focus for the credit union is our location . we have made plans to open an additional full - service facility that will be located in close proximity to the enron building in the downtown area with easy access . more information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available . at this time , our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members .
we are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members .
